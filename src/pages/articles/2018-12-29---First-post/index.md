Okay. Here we go!

This is the first post on this blog.
I don't think it will be as good as I want to, but since it's my first, I'm ok.

First of all, nice to meet you! I'm really happy that you came here to read this post.

Currently, I'm a computer engineering student. I have some professional experience(about 2 years) as a software developer. During this time, I worked with some technologies:

* Ruby on Rails,
* Node.js,
* React.js

I want to write about tech stuff, like the frameworks or tools that I'll use/study in the future. Alongside with it, I'll post some random stuff, like my thoughts about a TV show or video-game, or some other thing.

[Here](../../about) you can read more about myself.

See you next time!
